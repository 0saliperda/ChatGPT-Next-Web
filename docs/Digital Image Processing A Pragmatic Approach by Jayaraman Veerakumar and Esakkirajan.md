One of the most popular and comprehensive books on digital image processing is *Digital Image Processing* by S. Jayaraman, T. Veerakumar and S. Esakkirajan. This book provides a clear, up-to-date and practical introduction to the subject for students and practicing engineers. It covers the fundamental concepts and methods of image processing such as image representation, enhancement, restoration, segmentation, compression, feature extraction, recognition and classification. It also includes illustrative examples and MATLAB applications to help readers understand and implement the theory in practice.
 
The book is divided into 12 chapters that cover the following topics:
 
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Image Processing
- Chapter 2: Digital Image Fundamentals
- Chapter 3: Image Enhancement in Spatial Domain
- Chapter 4: Image Enhancement in Frequency Domain
- Chapter 5: Image Restoration
- Chapter 6: Color Image Processing
- Chapter 7: Image Compression
- Chapter 8: Morphological Image Processing
- Chapter 9: Image Segmentation
- Chapter 10: Representation and Description
- Chapter 11: Object Recognition
- Chapter 12: Wavelets and Multiresolution Processing

The book is published by Tata McGraw Hill Education and has received positive reviews from readers and experts. It is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in engineering and computer science as well as for self-study and reference.
  
One of the main features of the book is its illustrative approach, which uses numerous figures, tables and diagrams to explain the concepts and techniques of image processing. The book also provides several practical examples and case studies to demonstrate the applications of image processing in various domains such as face recognition, fingerprint recognition, iris recognition, license plate recognition, medical image analysis, satellite image analysis and more.
 
Another feature of the book is its MATLAB applications, which are given at the end of each chapter. These applications help the readers to implement the algorithms and methods discussed in the book using MATLAB, a popular software tool for numerical computation and visualization. The MATLAB code and images used in the book are also available online for download.
 
The book is written in a simple and lucid style that makes it easy to read and understand. The authors have used a logical and systematic approach to present the topics and have avoided unnecessary mathematical details and derivations. The book also contains review questions, multiple choice questions and exercises at the end of each chapter to test the readers' comprehension and reinforce their learning.
